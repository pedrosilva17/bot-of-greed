Some notes:

- Filtering by Link Markers will give you cards that have every specified marker or more.
- You can use the following notation for attack, defense, level, rank, link and scale: "lt" (less than), "lte" (less than or equal to), "gt" (greater than), "gte" (greater than or equal to).
Examples: `/search attack: lt2500` (attack is less than 2500), `/search defense: gte2000` (defense is greater than or equal to 2000), `/search level: lte8` (level is less than or equal to 8).
