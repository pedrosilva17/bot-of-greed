# Card images folder
This folder stores the card images of (almost) all available cards. Since I don't own the rights to use them (and there's a lot of images), I'd rather not risk uploading them here. If you want to host the bot yourself for some reason, download the card images using the get_all_card_images() function in the other_functions.py file (careful not to be rate limited or blacklisted).
