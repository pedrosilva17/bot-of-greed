# Bot of Greed
### It's time to ~~duel~~ draw!

![The bot's profile picture: A poorly drawn Pot of Greed.](profile.png)

**Bot of Greed** is a Discord bot, made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with the Disnake API wrapper, that uses the YGOProDeck API to display information about Yu-Gi-Oh cards in various ways. It is my first (sort of) medium scale project that I plan on developing for some time and, who knows, see it being used on some Discord servers.

## Installation

Download the source code as a .zip file or use git to pull the remote repository into a local one.

```
git init
git pull https://github.com/pedrosilva17/bot-of-greed.git
```

## Usage

Just typing a slash "/" in a text channel will reveal all the available commands. A short description is available for each one, as well as a specific one (/help) that provides you with a more detailed explanation regarding certain commands.

## Screenshots
*Coming in the near future (where I'm not as lazy as I am right now)*

## Current issues
Due to Python itself (in other words, sloppy coding in some sections), the bot is frequently slow and takes some time to run certain commands. This will be fixed in due time, when I become more used to writing clean code in Python and not just running my fingers through the keyboard until it works. I like to think the project is decently organized overall, but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. Remember: *you can help!*

### A note about card artworks
This bot will probably be hosted on a local computer for the time being. I did not upload the card artworks to GitHub because I'm not fully aware of what I can or cannot do with copyrighted images on the website, and maybe in the future I will find a cheap cloud hosting solution (If you have any ideas, message me in one of the social media I have linked on my personal repository). I left a message inside the artworks folder talking about this as well and what you can do to easily download the images yourself.
