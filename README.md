![The bot's profile picture: A poorly drawn Pot of Greed.](profile.png)

**Bot of Greed** is a Discord bot, made in Python with the Disnake API wrapper, that uses the YGOProDeck API to populate a database and display information about Yu-Gi-Oh cards in various ways.

## Installation

Download the source code as a .zip file or use git to clone the remote repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/pedrosilva17/bot-of-greed.git
```

## Usage

Just typing a slash "/" in a text channel will reveal all the available commands. A short description is available for each one, as well as a specific one (/help) that provides you with a more detailed explanation regarding certain commands.

Some documentation is still missing, but I'll complete it (eventually).

## Screenshots
*Coming in the near future (where I'm not as lazy as I am right now)*

### A note about card artworks
This bot will probably be hosted on a local computer for the time being. Card images are not on this repository, I do not own them. There's a message inside the artworks folder talking about card artworks as and what you can do to easily download the images yourself.
